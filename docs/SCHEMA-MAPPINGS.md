# Schema Objects and how they are mapped in Codd

A complete list of all columns that affect our DB hashing algorithm can be found in this document.
The rationale behind not including a column is that we don't want/need to include columns that satisfy any of these criteria:

- Are DB-instance-dependent: plain OIDs always satisfy this.
- Are already accounted for in a hierarchical on-disk ancestor or descendant.
- Affect naming of folders and/or files in the on-disk hashes.
- Are redundant, i.e. at least one other column will always change when the ignored column changes.
- Most importantly: do not affect any possible query's results for the Application User. On-Disk size of objects, user's password and others fall in this category.


**IMPORTANT:** Not all features are currently perfectly mapped. Search this document for "TODO" to find missing/imperfect mappings.

## Schemas

This comes from https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/catalog-pg-namespace.html

### Columns included

OidColumn PgAuthId "nspowner",  
"nspacl"  

### Ignored columns

-- oid	oid	 	Row identifier  
-- nspname	name	 	Name of the namespace  

## Tables, VIEWs, et al.

This comes from https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/catalog-pg-class.html

### Columns included

OidColumn PgType "reltype",  
OidColumn PgType "reloftype",  
OidColumn PgAuthId "relowner",  
OidColumn PgAccessMethod "relam",  
"relisshared",  
"relpersistence",  
"relkind",  
"relrowsecurity",  
"relforcerowsecurity",  
"relreplident",  
"relispartition",  
"relacl",  
"reloptions",  
"relpartbound"  

### Ignored columns

-- oid	oid	 	Row identifier  
-- relname	name	 	Name of the table, index, view, etc.  
-- relnamespace	oid	pg_namespace.oid	The OID of the namespace that contains this relation  
-- relfilenode	oid	 	Name of the on-disk file of this relation; zero means this is a “mapped” relation whose disk file name is determined by low-level state  
-- reltablespace	oid	pg_tablespace.oid	The tablespace in which this relation is stored. If zero, the database's default tablespace is implied. (Not   meaningful if the relation has no on-disk file.)  
-- relpages	int4	 	Size of the on-disk representation of this table in pages (of size BLCKSZ). This is only an estimate used by the planner. It is updated   by VACUUM, ANALYZE, and a few DDL commands such as CREATE INDEX.  
-- reltuples	float4	 	Number of live rows in the table. This is only an estimate used by the planner. It is updated by VACUUM, ANALYZE, and a few DDL   commands such as CREATE INDEX.  
-- relallvisible	int4	 	Number of pages that are marked all-visible in the table's visibility map. This is only an estimate used by the planner. It is   updated by VACUUM, ANALYZE, and a few DDL commands such as CREATE INDEX.  
-- reltoastrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	OID of the TOAST table associated with this table, 0 if none. The TOAST table stores large attributes “out of line” in a   secondary table.  
-- relhasindex	bool	 	True if this is a table and it has (or recently had) any indexes  
-- relnatts	int2	 	Number of user columns in the relation (system columns not counted). There must be this many corresponding entries in pg_attribute. See   also pg_attribute.attnum.  
-- relchecks	int2	 	Number of CHECK constraints on the table; see pg_constraint catalog  
-- relhasrules	bool	 	True if table has (or once had) rules; see pg_rewrite catalog  
-- relhastriggers	bool	 	True if table has (or once had) triggers; see pg_trigger catalog  
-- relhassubclass	bool	 	True if table or index has (or once had) any inheritance children  
-- relispopulated	bool	 	True if relation is populated (this is true for all relations other than some materialized views)  
-- relrewrite	oid	pg_class.oid	For new relations being written during a DDL operation that requires a table rewrite, this contains the OID of the original   relation; otherwise 0. That state is only visible internally; this field should never contain anything other than 0 for a user-visible relation.  
-- relfrozenxid	xid	 	All transaction IDs before this one have been replaced with a permanent (“frozen”) transaction ID in this table. This is used to track   whether the table needs to be vacuumed in order to prevent transaction ID wraparound or to allow pg_xact to be shrunk. Zero (InvalidTransactionId) if the   relation is not a table.  
-- relminmxid	xid	 	All multixact IDs before this one have been replaced by a transaction ID in this table. This is used to track whether the table needs to   be vacuumed in order to prevent multixact ID wraparound or to allow pg_multixact to be shrunk. Zero (InvalidMultiXactId) if the relation is not a table.

## Sequences

This comes from https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/catalog-pg-sequence.html

### Columns included

OidColumn PgType "seqtypid",  
"seqstart",  
"seqincrement",  
"seqmax",  
"seqmin",  
"seqcache",  
"seqcycle"  

Plus, all columns we include from pg_class are also included for sequences.

### Ignored columns

- seqrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	The OID of the pg_class entry for this sequence


### TODO

- Table that owns Sequence is not hashed.  
- The `RESTART` value of the sequence also isn't hashed.  

## Columns, Constraints/Indices and other Table-related attributes

This comes from https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/catalog-pg-attribute.html

### Columns included

OidColumn PgType "atttypid",  
"attnotnull",  
PureSqlExpression "SELECT pg_get_expr(pg_attrdef.adbin, pg_attrdef.adrelid) FROM pg_catalog.pg_attrdef WHERE pg_attrdef.adrelid=pg_attribute.attrelid AND   pg_attrdef.adnum=pg_attribute.attnum" -- This is what we use instead of "atthasdef", which is described as: This column has a default expression or generation   expression, in which case there will be a corresponding entry in the pg_attrdef catalog that actually defines the expression. (Check attgenerated to determine   whether this is a default or a generation expression.)  
"atthasmissing",  
"attidentity",  
"attgenerated",  
"attislocal",  
"attinhcount",  
OidColumn PgCollation "attcollation",  
"attacl",  
"attoptions",  
"attfdwoptions",  
"attmissingval"  

### Ignored columns

-- attrelid	oid	pg_class.oid	The table this column belongs to  
-- attname	name	 	The column name  
-- attstattarget	int4	 	attstattarget controls the level of detail of statistics accumulated for this column by ANALYZE. A zero value indicates that no   statistics should be collected. A negative value says to use the system default statistics target. The exact meaning of positive values is data type-dependent.   For scalar data types, attstattarget is both the target number of “most common values” to collect, and the target number of histogram bins to create.  
-- attlen	int2	 	A copy of pg_type.typlen of this column's type  
-- attnum	int2	 	The number of the column. Ordinary columns are numbered from 1 up. System columns, such as ctid, have (arbitrary) negative numbers.  
-- attndims	int4	 	Number of dimensions, if the column is an array type; otherwise 0. (Presently, the number of dimensions of an array is not enforced, so   any nonzero value effectively means “it's an array”.)  
-- attcacheoff	int4	 	Always -1 in storage, but when loaded into a row descriptor in memory this might be updated to cache the offset of the attribute   within the row  
-- atttypmod	int4	 	atttypmod records type-specific data supplied at table creation time (for example, the maximum length of a varchar column). It is   passed to type-specific input functions and length coercion functions. The value will generally be -1 for types that do not need atttypmod.  
-- attbyval	bool	 	A copy of pg_type.typbyval of this column's type  
-- attstorage	char	 	Normally a copy of pg_type.typstorage of this column's type. For TOAST-able data types, this can be altered after column creation to   control storage policy.  
-- attalign	char	 	A copy of pg_type.typalign of this column's type  
-- attisdropped	bool	 	This column has been dropped and is no longer valid. A dropped column is still physically present in the table, but is ignored by   the parser and so cannot be accessed via SQL.
